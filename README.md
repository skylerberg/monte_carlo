# monte_carlo

A rust library for Monte Carlo Tree Search.

Implements Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) using Upper Confidence Bound for Trees
(UCT).

Many optimizations are from [1].

## Planned

### MCTS-Solver [3]

This approach takes into account proven wins and losses.

* Decisive and Anti-Decisive Moves [2]


## Brain Dump

Built in optimizations:
* 

Configurable variants:
* Nondeterministic MCTS
  * Determinization
  * Information Set UCT (ISUCT) (I think I have this implemented)

Not implemented variants:
* Flat UCB
* Bandit Algorithm for Smooth Trees (BAST) (extends Flat UCB)
* Learning in MCTS (Is this actually a variant?)
* Single-Player MCTS (SP-MCTS)
  * Feature UCT Selection (FUSE)
* Multi-player MCTS
  * Coalition Reduction
* Multi-agent MCTS
  * Ensemble UCT
* Real-time MCTS
* Nondeterministic MCTS
  * Hindsight optimisation (HOP)
  * Sparse UCT
  * Multiple MCTS
  * UCT+
  * Monte Carlo alpha-beta (MC_alpha_beta)
  * Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret (MCCFR)
  * Inference and Opponent Modelling
  * Simultaneous Moves
* Recursive Approaches
  * Reflexive Monte Carlo Search
  * Nested Monte Carlo Search
  * Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA)
  * Meta-MCTS
  * Heuristically Guided Swarm Tree Search
* Sample-Based Planners
  * Forward Search Sparse Sampling (FSSS)
  * Threshold Ascent for Graphs (TAG)
  * RRTs
  * UNLEO
  * UCTSAT
  * _rho UCT
  * Monte Carlo Random Walks (MRW)
  * Mean-based Heuristic Search for Anytime Planning (MHSP)
